Hi Everyone ,

As part of second day of challenge I have did a Landing Page of an Eco Friendly Store.

The <head> tag contains metadata about the document, including the character encoding, viewport settings, and a reference to an external stylesheet using the <link> tag.

The <title> tag specifies the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar and search engine results.

The <body> tag contains the visible content of the webpage, including the navigation bar, header, and main sections.

The navigation bar is defined using the <nav> tag, which contains an image and a menu button. The image is specified using the <img> tag and the src attribute, and the menu button is created using three <span> tags. The CSS styles for the navigation bar are defined in an external stylesheet.

The header section contains a large heading, a subheading, a paragraph, and two buttons. The main heading is defined using the <h1> tag, and the subheading and paragraph are defined using the <p> tag. The buttons are created using the <button> tag. The header also contains a background image specified using the <div> tag with the class attribute set to "header-img". The CSS styles for the header section are defined in an external stylesheet.

The main sections for displaying products are defined using the <section> tag with the class attribute set to "section-one" and "products", respectively. The sections contain images, text, and buttons for navigating through the products. The products are displayed using the <div> tag with the class attribute set to "items". Each product contains an image, a name, a price, and a link to view more details. The CSS styles for the product sections are defined in an external stylesheet.

This is a CSS code for a website that sells eco-friendly clothes. It defines styles for various elements of the website such as the body, navigation, header, products section, and individual product items.

In the beginning, it sets some global styles for all elements using the universal selector *. Then it defines some custom properties using the :root pseudo-class to make it easier to change the values of these properties throughout the code.

The navigation section is styled to have a logo, menu, and some menu items. The header section has a background image, headings, and buttons. The products section has a heading, product categories, and individual product items.

Each product item is defined using a container with a background color, an image, name, price, and description. Overall, the CSS code uses a lot of flexbox properties to create a responsive layout that works well on different devices.
