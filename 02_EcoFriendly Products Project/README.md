Hi Everyone,

Eco-friendly Clothing Website

HTML CODE 
Firstly I have given the nav bar with a logo and menu bar.Then moving on to header section created a major class for all other nested classes in header. Used meaningful Classes to define each part of header.Then comes the main part of the project content of the project. Here I have thought for selling my stores products in the main content and have also mentioned some really cool images with classes for each of them like the for setting the image for the header,sections for the buttons and header images. Then nested all classes for all the 9 items in product class used seperate class for every single thing like for the item , item-name,item price and styled all of them in CSS.

CSS CODE

Sets the margin and padding of all elements to 0, and the box-sizing to border-box.
Sets the background color of the body to #111 and the height to 100vh.
Defines some variables that can be used throughout the stylesheet.
Styles the navigation bar with a logo, a menu button, and links.
Styles the header section with a heading, an image, and some text.
