Movie Showcase Cards

This is a simple HTML webpage that displays movie cards using Tailwind CSS, a popular CSS framework. The webpage consists of a container with four movie cards arranged in a grid layout, each containing an image, movie title, release date, and movie description. The movie cards are styled with different background colors, rounded corners, and shadow effects, and they also have hover effects applied to them to create an interactive user experience.
