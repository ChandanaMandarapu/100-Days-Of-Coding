Hello Everyone,

Art Shop 

Introduction
This is a simple HTML file that builds a website for an art shop. The code comprises three sections: the header, main section, and features section.

Header
The header section includes the navigation menu that appears on top of the webpage. The navigation menu contains six menu items (Home, Features, About, Gallery, Review, and Contact) that anchor to respective sections of the page.

Main Section
The main section comprises a background image, a title, and a paragraph. The background image occupies the entire screen, while the title and paragraph are vertically centered. The title and paragraph introduce the website and its offerings.

Features Section
The features section highlights the unique offerings of the art shop. The section contains a title, an image, and a description for each offering. The section uses a gradient background that transitions from fuchsia to indigo.

The Gallery section can be added by including HTML code for a new section, similar to the existing sections for Features and About. The background image and text content can be customized to fit the needs of the website.

The Review section can be added by including HTML code for a new section, similar to the existing sections for Features and About. The review content can be added in the form of individual cards or a grid of cards with review quotes and star ratings. The design can be customized to fit the needs of the website.
