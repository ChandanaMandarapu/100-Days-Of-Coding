Hello Everyone,

This repository contains HTML and TCSS code for a sample online fashion store, named "Summer Store".

The code includes a navigation bar, two cards displaying different summer outfits, a section with an image and text promoting the store's summer outfits, and a section with three promotional boxes. The code is designed using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, which provides a set of pre-designed classes that can be used to create custom user interfaces quickly.

The navigation bar consists of a logo and three links to explore, collections, and cart pages. The first card displays an image of a young man wearing a green t-shirt and black jeans, and the second card displays an image of a handsome man. Both cards also include a heading and a brief description. The image in the second card has a hover effect that scales it and moves it slightly up. The section below the cards includes a heading and a brief description of the summer outfits offered by the store, along with a "Shop Now" button. The last section includes three promotional boxes with headings, descriptions, and a button.
