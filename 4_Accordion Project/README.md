Hello Everyone,

Accordion project is a popular UI pattern which is visually appealing to hide and show content.

This is a HTML code for an accordion project. The code includes a list of questions and answers related to web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.

The HTML code contains a ul element with a class of "accordion", which serves as the container for the questions and answers. Each question is represented as an li element, which contains a label element with a for attribute that matches the id attribute of a corresponding input element.

The input elements are of type "radio" and have a name attribute that is set to "html", which groups them together. Each input element also has a unique id attribute. The content of each question is contained within a div element with a class of "content", which is initially hidden.

When the user clicks on a label, it activates the corresponding input element and shows the answer associated with that question by displaying the div element with the "content" class. The "checked" attribute in the first input element ensures that the first question is displayed by default when the page loads.


CSS code is all about

The .accordion class sets the margin and width of the component, and the .accordion li class styles the list items that will contain the accordion panels.

The label element within each list item is styled with padding, a navy border, and a font weight of 600. The span element inside the label is rotated to serve as an indicator for the accordion. The input[type="radio"] element is hidden using the adjacent sibling selector, and the .content class, which contains the content of each accordion panel, is styled with padding and hidden with a max-height of 0 and overflow set to hidden.
