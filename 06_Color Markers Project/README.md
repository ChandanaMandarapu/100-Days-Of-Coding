Hello Everyone,

Color markers project is a simple project to know about colors of Css in best way.

Here I have used only width,height,display properties to style the colors. But whole project on Colors I have used rgb values hex values and hsla values and also linear-gradients to understand how the colors actually work. Its a project of Freecodecamp. 

Additionals I added to the project are hover and animation properties which made it even more accesible and the User experince will also be better used transform transition and hover properties to make it more realistic.
