Hello Everyone,

The code consists of an HTML file with accompanying CSS styles. 
It creates animated quote cards displayed in a container with a gradient background. 
The HTML defines the structure of the webpage, while the CSS sets the styles for the container, quote cards, and quote text. 
The container is centered and hides overflow, and the quote cards have specific styling for background color, text color, border radius, padding, size, and hover effects.
