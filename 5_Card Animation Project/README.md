Hello Everyone,

Cards Animation Project is all about how the images show different animations when hovered.


CSS:

The body element is set to display as flexbox with wrap property, which aligns the card container and image card in a centered layout with a background gradient.

The card-container section is styled with a fixed width, padding, background color, and a hidden overflow. It also has a pseudo-element (:before) with a dark violet background that transitions on hover to create an effect.

The content within the card-container section has a z-index to position it above the pseudo-element, and the text color changes on hover.

The img-card section represents the image container, with a fixed size, a white background, and a box shadow. It also has pseudo-elements (:before and :after) with transitions and box shadows that create hover effects.

The image within the img-card section has absolute positioning and object-fit set to cover, and it transitions on hover by moving up slightly.

This code creates a card design with a visually appealing layout and hover effects for an interactive user experience. You can use this code as a starting point for creating your own card designs in your web projects, and you may want to customize the styles, content, and images to suit your specific needs.
