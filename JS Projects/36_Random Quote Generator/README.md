Hello Everyone,

This code is for a simple web page that generates a random emoji when a user hovers over the emoji displayed on the page. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the web page, including a div element with the id "emoji" that displays the initial emoji (in this case, the "rolling on the floor laughing" emoji). The CSS file styles the page, with a blue background color and a centered display. The JavaScript file contains the main functionality of the page, with an event listener attached to the "emoji" div that listens for a "mouseover" event. When the event is triggered, a random emoji is generated from an array of emojis using the Math.random() function, and the "emoji" div is updated with the new emoji. Additionally, the CSS contains some hover effects on the "emoji" div that make the emoji larger and remove the grayscale filter when a user hovers over it. Overall, this code creates a fun and interactive experience for users, and can be easily customized to include other emojis or additional functionality.
