Hello Everyone,

This project is a Mood Tracker Project using Html , Css , JS (DOM).

This code uses basic JavaScript and the DOM to handle the saving and displaying of mood data in the mood tracker. It first gets references to the HTML elements for the date picker, mood select, and save button using document.getElementById(). Then it sets up an empty mood history object and checks if there is any existing mood history data in local storage using localStorage.getItem() and JSON.parse().

Next, it adds a click event listener to the save button using addEventListener(). When the button is clicked, it gets the selected date and mood from the date picker and mood select elements, saves the mood to the mood history object, and saves the mood history object to local storage using localStorage.setItem() and JSON.stringify(). Finally, it displays a success message using alert().

On page load, the code loops through the mood history object and creates a new div element for each date and mood pair using document.createElement() and .textContent. It then appends each div element to the mood history section using .appendChild(). The styling for the mood tracker is handled by the CSS in the head section of the HTML document.
