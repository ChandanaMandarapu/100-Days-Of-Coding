Hello Everyone ,

This code defines a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code creates a basic structure of the web page, which includes a heading, an input field for adding new tasks, a button to add new tasks, a container for displaying all the added tasks, and an image that is set as the background. 

The CSS code sets the styles for different elements of the web page like background, font-family, padding, border, color, and size. 

Finally, the JavaScript code defines the functionality of the application. It retrieves the DOM elements using their respective IDs, creates an empty array called tasks, and defines several functions. The addTask() function takes a task as an input parameter and creates an li element containing the task's name and a "Delete" button. 

It also adds a click event listener to the task, which toggles its status from incomplete to complete or vice versa. The deleteTask() function deletes a task from the tasks array and updates the UI accordingly. The renderTasks() function updates the UI by iterating through the tasks array and calling the addTask() function for each task. 

The saveTasks() function saves the tasks to the browser's local storage, and the loadTasks() function retrieves the tasks from the local storage and renders them on the UI. Finally, an event listener is added to the "Add" button to create a new task, add it to the tasks array, and update the UI accordingly.
