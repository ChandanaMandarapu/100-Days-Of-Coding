Hello Everyone,

This code is for a simple web page that displays a random image when the user clicks on a button. The page has a title, a header with the title "Random Image Generator", an image container, a button with the text "Generate Image", and a paragraph with the text "Click the button below to generate a new image".

The style of the page is defined using CSS code. The background color of the page is black, the text is centered, and the font used is 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif. The header text is colored pale green and has a font size of 3rem. The image container has a width and height of 500px, a 5px solid white border, and is set to hide any overflow. The image within the container is set to fit its dimensions using object-fit: cover. The button has a black background, pale green border and text, and a font size of 18px. When the user hovers over the button, the background color changes to a light green and the text color changes to black.

The JavaScript code defines an array of image URLs and selects the image container, button, and paragraph elements from the HTML code using their respective IDs. It then defines a function that generates a random number between 0 and the length of the image array, selects a random image URL from the array using the generated number, and updates the HTML code within the image container to display the selected image. Finally, it adds an event listener to the button so that when the button is clicked, the generateRandomImage() function is called, which generates and displays a new random image.
