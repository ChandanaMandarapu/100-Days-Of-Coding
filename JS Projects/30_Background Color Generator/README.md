Hello Everyone,

Today I'd like to share with you a code snippet for a Background Color Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This generator allows you to click on a button and change the background color of your web page to a random hex color code.

The HTML and CSS code provide the structure and styling for the web page. The HTML file contains a button and a heading element. The CSS file styles the elements to give them a modern and sleek look. The body element is set to a specific background color to start with.

The JavaScript code uses the DOM (Document Object Model) to select the button and the heading elements by their respective IDs. It also contains a function that generates a random hex color code. When the button is clicked, the background color of the body is changed to a random color, and the heading text is updated with the new hex code.
