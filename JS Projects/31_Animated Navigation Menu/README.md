Hello Everyone,

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for an animated navigation menu. The menu is designed to expand and contract when a user clicks on the toggle button. 

The HTML code includes a navigation bar and an unordered list of menu items. The CSS code styles the menu, setting its background color, font family, and text color. 

The menu also has a button with two lines, which will toggle the menu when clicked. The JavaScript code listens for a click event on the toggle button and toggles the 'active' class on the navigation bar, causing it to expand and show the menu items.
