Hello Everyone,

This is a code for an image slider that displays a series of images on a web page, with buttons to navigate to the previous or next image. The HTML code contains a container div with a class of "slider", which contains a series of image elements, each with a unique source URL. The first image is initially set to have a class of "active".

The CSS code provides some styling to the slider and the images, including setting the background color, size and position of the slider, and adding a border radius to the images.

The JavaScript code uses querySelector and querySelectorAll methods to select the slider, all images within it, and the prev and next buttons. The code defines a function called "showSlide" which takes an argument "n" that represents the index of the slide to display. This function removes the "active" class from the current slide, sets the value of "currentSlide" to the new index (using modulo arithmetic to ensure that it wraps around to the beginning if necessary), and adds the "active" class to the new slide.

The code then adds event listeners to the prev and next buttons, which call the "showSlide" function with the appropriate index (either one less or one more than the current slide index). Finally, the code calls the "showSlide" function with the initial slide index (which is set to 0 by default), to display the first image.
