Hello Everyone,

This code is a simple auto text generator that displays a randomly selected word on a webpage using JavaScript. The HTML file has a paragraph element that displays the word "JavaScript Is" with a blinking cursor following it. The JavaScript file has an array of words to be displayed, and it has functions to type out the words one letter at a time, and then erase them one letter at a time before typing out a new word. The CSS file has styles to format the webpage, including setting the background color, centering the text, and changing the color and size of certain elements.

Overall, this code is a great example of how JavaScript can be used to create interactive and dynamic content on a webpage, and it could be used as a starting point for creating more complex auto text generators or other interactive content.
