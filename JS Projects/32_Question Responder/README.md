Hi everyone, in this post I'll be explaining the code for a simple "Question Responder" project, which is a fun way to get quick answers to yes or no questions. Let's take a look at the code:

First, we have some HTML code that sets up the basic structure of the web page. It includes a title, some CSS styling, and a container div with a class of "question-responder". Inside this div, we have an h1 tag that displays the heading "Question Responder", followed by a paragraph that asks the user to enter a yes or no question, an input field for the user to type in their question, a button to get the answer, and a div with an id of "answer" to display the answer.

Next, we have some CSS styling that sets the background color, font family, and font size for the web page. It also styles the container div and its child elements to be centered and spaced out in a column.

Moving on to the JavaScript code, we first create two variables: "button" to select the button element using its id, and "answerDiv" to select the div that will display the answer using its id.

Then we define an array of 20 possible answers to the user's question, ranging from positive to negative. These answers will be randomly selected and displayed in the "answer" div.

We then add an event listener to the button using the "addEventListener" method. This will trigger a function when the button is clicked.

Inside the function, we first get the value of the user's question from the input field using the "getElementById" method, and store it in a variable called "question".

We then check if the question field is empty. If it is, we display a message in the answer div asking the user to enter a question, and set the text color to white using the "style" property. If the question field is not empty, we randomly select an answer from the answers array using the "Math.random" and "Math.floor" methods, and display it in the answer div using the "innerText" property. We also set the text color to black using the "style" property.
