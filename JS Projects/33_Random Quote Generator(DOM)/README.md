Hello Everyone,

This is a basic webpage that generates a random quote every time you click the "Generate Quote" button. The webpage has a background image .
The quote is displayed in the center of the page and changes each time the button is clicked. The quotes are stored in an array, and the JavaScript code randomly selects one of the quotes and displays it on the page. 
This is a simple project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great starting point for beginners who want to learn about web development.
