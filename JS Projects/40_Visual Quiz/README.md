Hello Everyone,

This is a basic quiz game designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure contains a form element with five questions about HTML and CSS. Each question has three possible answers with radio buttons to select only one answer. 

The CSS styles the quiz-container with a background image, colors, font family, and layouts the questions, answers, and submit button. The JavaScript code will be linked to the HTML file through the main.js file to handle user interactions with the quiz game. Overall, this is a simple and fun way to test your knowledge of HTML and CSS!
